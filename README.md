   I started programming at 9 years old with a Web Design course, but I move away from this area and 
   came back to programming just when I got to college, with 18 years old, of System Analysis and Development at Fatec and 
   since then I didn't stop.

   Had already worked in a company focused on Digital Marketing, for a company focused on commercial automation, and 
   most recently for a company that offers to their clients tech solutions to sell its products online.
   This opened my mind and helped me to develop my logic, tech skills and to handle a lot of types of people. 
   But I always think that is possible to improve myself and help others with their problems, so I'm waiting for you to a new adventure.
